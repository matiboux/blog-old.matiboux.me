Introducing a new personal website for myself: a blog!
<!--more-->

The purpose of this blog is to complement my showcase website [matiboux.me](https://matiboux.me). The idea is that, while showcasing a list of all my projects on my website, I could write a few articles here for some of them in order to go in depth about why and how I worked on them. In the end, this blog will basically be a place about my personal work and opinions, whatever all that may be.

I hope you can find some content interesting to you here!

Don't forget to take a look at my [showcase website](https://matiboux.me).
You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/matiboux), where this blog is actually hosted!

Finally, you can contact me by opening an issue on Github or via [Telegram](https://t.me/Matiboux).
